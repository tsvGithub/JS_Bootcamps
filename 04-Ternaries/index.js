// NB: Continue to use if/else statements

// Coding Challenge #4
/*
Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator 
for whenever he goes eating in a resturant. In his 
country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is 
between 50 and 300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.

1. Your task is to caluclate the tip, depending on the bill value. 
Create a variable called 'tip' for this. It's not allowed to use an if/else statement ðŸ˜… 
2. Print a string to the console containing the bill value, 
the tip, and the final value (bill + tip). 
Example: 'The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value 316.25'

TEST DATA: Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430
HINT: To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it by 20/100 = 0.2
HINT: Value X is between 50 and 300, if it's >= 50 && <= 300 ðŸ˜‰
GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
*/
// let bill = 275;
// let bill = 40;
let bill = 430;

let tip = bill >= 50 && bill <= 300 ? bill * 0.15 : bill * 0.2;
let totalValue = bill + tip;
console.log(`The bill was ${bill}, the tip was ${tip}, and the total value ${totalValue}`);
