/*
There are two gymnastics teams, Dolphins and Koalas. 
They compete against each other 3 times. The winner 
with the highest average score wins the a trophy!

1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below
TEST DATA: Dolphins score 96, 108 and 89. Koalas score 88, 91 and 110
*/

let koalasAverScore = Math.round((88 + 91 + 110) / 3);
console.log(koalasAverScore); //96
//2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition,
//and print it to the console. Don't forget that there can be a draw, so test for
//that as well (draw means they have the same average score).
if (dolphinsAverScore > koalasAverScore) {

} else {
  console.log(`There is a draw with score ${dolphinsAverScore} : ${koalasAverScore} `);
}
//Dolphins won with score 98 : 96

/*
3. BONUS 1: Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. 
With this rule, a team only wins if it has a higher score than t
he other team, and the same time a score of at least 100 points. 
HINT: Use a logical operator to test for minimum score, as well 
as multiple else-if blocks ðŸ˜‰ */

} else {
  console.log(`There is no winner with score Dolphins ${dolphinsAverScore} and Koalas ${koalasAverScore}`);
}
//There is no winner with score Dolphins 98 and Koalas 96

/*
4. BONUS 2: Minimum score also applies to a draw! 
So a draw only happens when both teams have the same score a
nd both have a score greater or equal 100 points. Otherwise, no team wins the trophy.
TEST DATA BONUS 1: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 123
TEST DATA BONUS 2: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 106
GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
